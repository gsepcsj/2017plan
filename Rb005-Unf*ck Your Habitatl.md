1.Who This Book Is For

Unfuck Your Habitat is for people who are overwhelmed with their mess, whether it’s a little or a lot. And if it is a lot, that’s totally okay. No need to pretend you’ve scrubbed your floors...ever.

On the other hand, if you’re already a neat person but want to reach some next-level minimalism, this isn’t the book for you. Instead, head over to The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up.

2.What You’ll Get

Getting Started: This section addresses all the mental blocks that might be in the way of getting off your butt and beginning to make a dent in your mess. It also introduces the “20/10” system: 20 minutes of cleaning, followed by a 10 minute break. The break is not optional, which seems shockingly wasteful at first—but the idea is to stop you from going on cleaning benders that leave you loath to ever clean a thing again.

Unfucking Your Own Habitat: This section gives the basics on the most important things to clean (anything that could smell gets priority, followed by tables and countertops) and includes tips on organizing and on building habits.

Troubleshooting: Dealing With Other People in Your Fucked-Up Space: Here comes the human element: how to deal with your messy roommate, and how to give or accept help.

Special Cases: This features two excellent walk-throughs: one for emergency cleaning when company is coming, and one for how to tackle a move. It also includes chapters on cleaning up your digital life, and on applying the book’s principles to tackling mountains of work or schoolwork.

Conclusion: The best part of this section is the chapter of Unfuck Your Habitat fundamentals, which might have worked better if it came earlier in the book—but whatever, here it is.

Appendices: This section of resources includes a bunch of checklists for what to do daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonally, as well as room-by-room lists to give you a road map when you see a messy bathroom, say, and don’t know where to start.

After you’ve devoured the book, don’t forget to check out the Unfuck Your Habitat tumblr, which inspired the book. You’ll find an advice column, a series of challenges, and a bunch of before and after pictures that people have sent in. Hoffman encourages taking lots of pictures to document your progress.
